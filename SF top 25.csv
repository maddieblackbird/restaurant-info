Once we walked through the door though we were transported to a different world. The decoration reminded of Peranakan homes I have seen in Singapore.
You need to reserve in advance and decide if you are going with fixed 2 or 4 course meal. This is not your typical Malaysian nor Straits style food. Truly amazing and by end of the meal you will be full!
Wish I could have had seconds of the trifle desert though!!
On the pricey side as with drinks looking at >$120 per person.
Great choice for a memorable night out.",Justin Williams,5,"Here is the poem referencing the restaurant and review highlights, followed by the most mentioned dish:","Azalina's is quite the find
With flavors that dance and delight the mind
Some bumps along the way

Patisserie, on the corner of California and Divisadero you will find heaven on earth.

You are given a number and patiently wait for a table, the tables keep turning, leaving small pastry crust all over, the servers keep cleaning and delivering food; be patient; you will soon be rewarded. l had the chocolate banana almond croissant,  enough for two people to share, it was crispy and golden brown around the edges and the filling was slightly sweet not overpowering chocolate banana filling, soon to be my favorite morning treat while having coffee with my wife. I also ordered the cortado, good quality coffee beans served in a small cup, I could not resist and also ordered the open face Ham and Cheese with sliced French Swiss Cheese and Bechamel, piping hot…heavenly served on a plate with fork and knife.

Servers have great knowledge of the food and their origins. The wine list has many high end options even for per-glass. The chef is part of Dom Perignon society apparently. Per cuisine, the menu is a celebration of Mexican food. Everything from the tortillas to beans tastes so good. The most memorable dishes for me were potato soup with caviar, mole sauces, and tamales and chocolate dessert.

With counters piled high, plates made before your eyes
Grandma's sloppy Joe brings back memories of pies
The Reuben though, swimming in dressing, no zing to the kraut
Stale bread and cold meat brought disappointment, no doubt

We ordered the fig popover, lamb chickpea soup of the day, and polenta, all fantastic with unique stand-alone flavor profiles. I loved the soup so much, I will probably go back to buy the cookbook. For a Sunday brunch, the place wasn’t too busy, so the environment was very relaxed.

Lived in the city for five years and always seen the spot while passing through, but finally glad it took a friend visiting to discover this great spot.",Rachel,5,Here is the poem response:,"On Market Street in foggy town
Zuni Cafe of great renown
Historic bones and city views 
Fig popovers can't lose
Lamb soup that makes you grin
Stay awhile and settle in
