1. Get in line early, the place opens at 5pm and the line starts building at 3:30pm some days. They usually seat the first 30-40 people in line right away. Leave a few tables for reservations then take additional reservations from the rest of folks.

2. Come for the pizza. Just order the pizza. Don’t get worried about desserts or apps or what not. If you’re hungry order another pizza.

3. Be patient. Both the chef and servers are always under pressure to accommodate everyone. Every pizza is touched by the chef, every pizza is going in fresh and coming out fresh just for you. What makes this pizza so great is the freshness from the oven to your plate.

Don’t go if you’re in a rush. Leave your evening open, have a glass of wine, enjoy the interior and cozy up.",Jasraj Singh,5,Margherita,"Here is a draft personal email intro describing my experience at Una Pizza Napoletana with friends:

Both noodle dishes are amazingly flavorful and plentiful. I would 100% order then every time I come back

The crispy cauliflower was okay, but not particularly crispy and I feel like the sauce should be thicken so it sticks to the cauliflower.

The Hainanese Duck is cooked very well and tender. The crispy rice is very flavorful and matches the dish very well.

The coco rice is amazing and 100% mandatory.

First off it was delicious. I left feeling satisfied but not stuffed and felt that it was a great value for the price and the quality was there in every dish.

The first dish was my least favorite, the croissant was flavorful but served room temp and didn’t love that, and the mushroom broth wasn’t hitting it for me.

Other than that I would order and eat every item again.

The desert was tasty but not something I would probably go out of my way to order.

With each dish I felt like I was a lucky judge getting to taste a chopped creation, as they transformed ingredients into things I’ve never seen or tried but were familiar ingredients.

The service was about two hours long, we sat at the counter and got to watch them in action in the kitchen. Reminded me of the bear but less angry!

Service was confusing at times with different staff dropping the food and offering varying levels of description of each dish and not having the menu at the table as the meal unfolded I wasn’t always sure what we were getting and couldn’t hear the explanations too well at times.

Some flat wear and glassware was served to us still wet which was not a good sign for a Michelin star level spot and a napkin I received had a stain on it.

My love for Thai food meant I have some very high expectations, and this place did not disappoint.

It is hard to define Lovely Day in the first place. It is, for sure, not trendy. But despite its dim & aging interior, it is not mundane either. In fact, the crowd we've seen is still overwhelmingly the young and hip Nolita type. They approved this over $60 brunch? Unknowable universe!

This place passed my curry test for how spicy it was. I did not see this coming - it was disguised as a green curry, which is typically less spicy than red curry. What kind of chili was that?

They also make some of the best Pad Thais out there. It has a chewy texture coupled with the distinctive sour taste that saves it from being too dense, a mistake many Thai places make too often. Coupled with the coconut milk soup and you just had a happier dinner than you might ask for.

I heard many locals longed to keep this place a secret, and I can see why. But seeing how much dedication this place poured into itself, I'd hate for it to go out of business. Kind reminder that they have a bar too if you need some liquor with your Thai ;)",Michael Davis,5,"Based on the reviews, the most popular/most-mentioned dish or drink at Lovely Day is the green curry.","Here is a draft personal-sounding email intro describing an experience with friends at Lovely Day:

They started as a salumeria in Rome, so try some of the salumi. Definitely get the Roman classics. Pasta Burro e Parmigiano, Amatriciana, Carbonara are our favorites. Do not forget the tiramisu.

I've eaten at Roscioli a number of times now. If you want the full menu, dinner is when you should go. Lunch is a smaller menu but they do a $55 pre-fixe which is actually priced very well and it is filling.

They rotate their apps seasonally but if you're their for dinner, definitely try the prosciutto and their burrata. The prosciutto (being a salumeria) is a cut above the rest. The burrata is incredibly creamy as you'd expect. We really liked the one with the crispy artichokes and zucchini.

For pastas, the butter and parmigiano pasta started as a special but it's on the menu permanently now. They use a mixture of three different aged parms and French butter. The Amatriciana is my favorite of the staple Roman pastas, the Carbonara is a close second.

Definitely get the tiramisu. Their other dishes are also very good too but if you've managed to snag a reservation and it's your first time - stick with the classic items.",Patrick Wong,5,Tiramisu,"Here is a draft personal email intro describing my experience:

💛✨Chipa was delicious. So soft, crumbled in mouth with a little chewy texture.

Aifajor was ok, still good but average.

1️⃣Definitely going back💕💕💕 Great hidden gem in the area with goooood pastries. The space was so cozy, and the staff were nice.

💖✨Morning bun was crispy and doughy with a nice cinnamon touch and sweetness.

Chef Shion does everything solo and his craftsmanship is something to witness over the course of your meal. Not just the nigiri - the ostumami are very memorable as well. Save it for a special occasion but the question is - is it worth it? Yes, it is.

Shion was a place I had heard about for a long time and I did have the chance to dine with him at Amane. This is many years ago but he's clearly honed his skillset because this was a very enjoyable meal.

Much more traditional than most places, there are a ton of otsumami (starters) followed by the nigiri course. Many of the apps are very unique and super flavorful. I especially enjoyed all the different cooked fish plates with different styles. The uni tasting was great where there were three types of uni, including one from his hometown.

The shari (as expected) was excellent, nice texture and chew - not too salty/sour. All the nigiri was excellent, the aji and kohada were especially noteworthy. Just the flavor profile, the mouthfeel, the bite - outstanding. The standout for me was the temaki. It's what really blew me away. This is the cylinder-shaped hand roll and it's packed nicely with a very fatty tuna mince. What's different is he uses chopped raw onion, which balances this out so beautifully. I would put this in the top 3 hand rolls I've ever had, might even be the best omakase temaki.

This a traditional place and definitely on the more serious side. Very light music, piano jazz as is typical. If you're looking for a ""vibe"" - this is not the place. If you're hear to really bask in sushi perfection, then you've found the right one.",Patrick Wong,5,temaki,"Here is a draft personal-sounding email intro describing an experience with friends at the restaurant:

Last weekend I met up with a group of friends at Shion 69 for an amazing meal featuring their renowned temaki hand rolls; the cozy ambiance and fantastic service made for an unforgettable lunch together."
