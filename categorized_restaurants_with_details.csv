I discovered this charming spot while searching for nearby restaurants around my hotel and was immediately drawn to its appeal. When I arrived, I was impressed by the warm and inviting atmosphere, with a unique and thoughtfully designed interior that gives the place its own personality. Despite the restaurant being packed with customers, I was fortunate to be seated quickly at the bar since I was dining alone.

I ordered the steak and eggs, which were both flavorful and beautifully plated. The dish was satisfying, and the overall presentation was excellent. The staff here truly stood out with their outstanding service—friendly, attentive, and consistently ensuring that all guests felt welcome and cared for.

Sisterita’s menu offers a wide variety of options, catering to all tastes. While I didn’t get to explore many dishes this time due to feeling a bit tired from my travels, the delightful ambiance and exceptional service left a lasting impression. I’m already planning to return and try more of their offerings on my next visit.

They offer open seating in their bar area, back room, and even outside. Once seated, our waiter came over to give us all the menus including their weekday happy hour (17:00 - 19:00), mains, and drinks.

We started with their Carne Asada Tacos and Ceviche Tostadas from the happy hour menu. Both were phenomenal. The ceviche was fresh on top of crispy corn tortilla and the mock carne asada was flavorful that you really couldn't tell it apart from the meat version.

For our mains, we shared a few items for the table including the Carne Asada Nachos, Oyster Mushroom Calamari (HIT!), Crispy Mushroom Potato Gratin (heavenly), and their Teriyaki Chicken Skewers. Every single item we had was delicious, well executed, and surprisingly very filling which was good since the pricing is higher being in the city.

I had a last minute home showing  late in the day on a Saturday in the Alameda area. I asked my husband to drive me so we could grab dinner after. While I was in the showing , he looked up places to eat in the area and came upon Ceron Kitchen.

We are so happy we found this place! This is definitely a higher end establishment and would be a great place for a special celebration or business dinner. However, diners on the patio were enjoying the relaxing, more casual atmosphere and there were families with children and groups of younger people enjoying drinks. Not a stuffy place at all.

The restaurant is aesthetically gorgeous, (Reas about the owner on their website, he is a home builder as well). The staff was professional and very knowledgeable but also super friendly and fun to talk to. The drinks and food were top notch! Definitely a fine dining experience.

They have a great creative cocktail menu( we tried a couple and they were delicious) and an extensive wine list. The menu was varied with many intriguing dishes in both the First and the Main courses and there were so many things we wanted to try! We settled on sharing a wonderful Blueberry & Strawberry Salad and the Street Corn for our Firsts. Both exceptionally good and made with the freshest produce. I have eaten a lot of “ street” style Mexican corn ( Esquites) and this was an elevated version. Delicious.

For entrees my husband got the Duck with Mushroom Risotto and I got the Frutti Di Mare.  Both exceptional!!  These dishes  were both done exceedingly well. The duck was amazing, the seafood fresh and the Pasta in the Frutti Di Mare was cooked to perfection.

We don’t usually eat dessert, but we made an exception here because of how good the food was. We got the Chocolate Silk Pie and were not disappointed! So worth the calories!!!!

Ceron Kitchen is the perfect reason to head out yo charming Alameda. We strolled around the downtown area for a bit after dinner (since we ate every last bite!) and enjoyed the restaurants location. We will be back! There are so many other dishes we want to try and this will be a great special occasion or business dinner spot as well.",Heather MacFarland,5,Frutti Di Mare,Here is the response in two paragraphs:,"I stopped in a couple weekends ago with my wife for dinner and we ordered the Frutti Di Mare - it was so fresh and delicious!

This is a wonderful little restaurant, on the fourth floor of Burk Hall, that's only open on Tuesdays and Wednesdays currently. You should make a reservation on Yelp, but I think they allow walk-ins. There's a prix fix option, which is just under $20.50 after tax. You get to choose an appetizer, entree, and dessert, and drinks. Only cash or checks are accepted.

The bread provided was foccacia cut into diamond-shaped pieces. The bread that they first brought out was hard and dry, so I told them it was hard. More bread was brought out promptly and it was softer, but still dry. I didn't tell them it was dry because I didn't want to be difficult. I had some lemonade to drink, and it was pretty good. I also had tea at the end, but it was piping hot and I didn't get a chance to drink much. It was fine.

I chose to have the house green salad for my appetizer. It was a good mix of leafy-greens covered in vinaigrette. It wasn't special, but good. I decided to have the pasta of the week for my entree. It was penne pasta salad with feta cheese, capers, and cooked grape tomatoes. It was absolutely delicious and I basically inhaled it. For dessert, I chose the pumpkin bundt cake. It was fantastic. It was moist, soft, a little misshapen, but still delicious. The créme anglaise was like melted ice cream, and I loved it.

The waiters were students and had more to learn. Service was very good, despite mistakes. The person who seemed like an instructor was great. You won't be able to find a three-course fine-dining meal anywhere else in San Francisco for the same price. The portions are good sizes and you'll leave feeling fed, but not stuffed. I highly recommend checking this place out.",Neal,5,"Based on the reviews, the most popular/most-mentioned dish or drink is:

penne pasta",Here is the response in two paragraphs:,"I recently visited The Vista Room with some friends and we tried the penne pasta special - it was absolutely delicious! The student waiters were very welcoming and provided great service. We had such a lovely time. 

I noticed on their hours that The Vista Room is only open for lunch on Tuesdays and Wednesdays from 11:45am-1:50pm. I'd suggest Michelle plan to stop by either day after the main lunch rush, say around 1:30pm. That way it hopefully won't be too crowded and she'll have a more relaxed dining experience."

I'd suggest Michelle plan to stop by on a Wednesday evening right at 5pm when they open for dinner service. Things likely won't pick up much until later in the evening. Alternatively, I'd propose Thursday just before 5pm as well.

RECENTLY I had their Monday evening cannellini beans dish, warmed me right up after I had a red nose from ocean beach wanderings. A rich broth but still light as a soup, LOVED the Al dente cook of it, not shelly but the perfect teeth to the coziness, paired perfectly with the bread 5 stars.

We ordered coffee, which I heard was one of their popular dishes. The service was exceptional and the ambiance was warm and welcoming. We had a wonderful morning catching up over great food and coffee in a charming little cafe.

I noticed on their website that Home Plate is open 7 days a week for breakfast and lunch. It seems they are typically less busy earlier in the week. I would suggest Michelle plan to stop by on a Tuesday or Wednesday morning, shortly after they open at 7am. This would allow her to check out the restaurant when it's quieter before the lunch crowds arrive."

Despite arriving without a reservation, the warm and welcoming hosts accommodated us graciously and even recommended an excellent nearby bar while we waited. The atmosphere was intimate yet inviting, with dim lighting that perfectly set the mood while still showcasing the stunning presentation of the dishes. The playlist added to the ambiance—it was impeccably curated by Andy, the music director, whom we were lucky enough to chat with. Our servers, Christian and Alfredo, were knowledgeable and friendly.

We opted for the nine-course pasta tasting menu, which was nothing short of transformative. Our journey began with the amberjack crudo, a bright and vibrant opener. Since I don’t eat seafood, my substitute—perfectly ripe Haas avocado—was creamy and refreshing, setting a lovely tone for the meal. The next course, today’s ricotta, was a masterclass in balance. The creamy ricotta paired beautifully with the sweetness of huckleberry jam and the slight tang of sourdough tigelle, creating a delightful interplay of flavors.

The cacio e pepe arancini was a playful yet elevated take on the Roman classic. Each bite was perfectly crisp on the outside, giving way to a rich, peppery interior that delivered the comforting essence of cacio e pepe in a whole new form. Following this was the standout of the evening: the black truffle sformato. With its understated presentation, the dish allowed the flavors to shine. The rich, velvety truffle custard was expertly balanced by the creaminess of parmigiano, while the crispy potato provided textural contrast. A delicate drizzle of truffle honey added a hint of sweetness that elevated the dish to perfection—easily one of the best things I’ve ever tasted.

Next came the saffron corzetti, a delicate and aromatic dish. Although I skipped the trout, my substitution—a cabbage-forward preparation—was refreshing and light, with subtle herbal notes that kept the dish bright. The squash cappelletti was a standout pasta course for me, showcasing an incredible balance of flavors. The cocoa bean and brown butter sauce added richness, while the salsa macha brought just the right amount of spice to elevate the dish without overpowering it.

The tortellini en brodo was pure comfort in a bowl. The tender tortellini, filled with earthy matsutake mushroom and creamy fontina, was perfectly complemented by the warming, deeply flavorful broth. Drinking the broth felt like a warm hug—this dish was a personal favorite. The meal then transitioned to heartier flavors with the veal ravioli, where the rye and rainbow chard added depth, and the currant mostarda brought a subtle sweetness that made the dish shine. Paired with the acorn orecchiette, it was a perfect juxtaposition. The orecchiette’s charred broccolini and Calabrian chili offered a smoky, spicy edge.

This tasting menu was a masterful progression, moving seamlessly from light and fresh to rich and indulgent. Every dish was cooked to perfection and thoughtfully constructed to create a cohesive culinary journey. Flour + Water has completely redefined my understanding of Italian cuisine, and I cannot wait to return to explore more of their artistry. Luckily, we live in the neighborhood!",Erika Coury,5,"Based on the reviews, the most mentioned dish or drink is pasta.

The cocoa bean and brown butter sauce added richness, while the salsa macha brought just the right amount of spice to elevate the dish without overpowering it.

The tortellini en brodo was pure comfort in a bowl. The tender tortellini, filled with earthy matsutake mushroom and creamy fontina, was perfectly complemented by the warming, deeply flavorful broth. Drinking the broth felt like a warm hug—this dish was a personal favorite. The meal then transitioned to heartier flavors with the veal ravioli, where the rye and rainbow chard added depth, and the currant mostarda brought a subtle sweetness that made the dish shine. Paired with the acorn orecchiette, it was a perfect juxtaposition. The orecchiette’s charred broccolini and Calabrian chili offered a smoky, spicy edge.

This tasting menu was a masterful progression, moving seamlessly from light and fresh to rich and indulgent. Every dish was cooked to perfection and thoughtfully constructed to create a cohesive culinary journey. Flour + Water has completely redefined my understanding of Italian cuisine, and I cannot wait to return to explore more of their artistry. Luckily, we live in the neighborhood!",Erika Coury,5,"Based on the reviews, the most mentioned dish or drink is pasta.

We ordered several of their decadent pasta dishes like the saffron corzetti and squash cappelletti. The food was incredible, and the atmosphere was so cozy and romantic.

At $15.99 per pound, it’s a bit pricey, but the ingredients, from vegetables to meats, were all very fresh, which made it worth it. The process involves lining up to pick your ingredients, so be prepared for some wait time. I spent around $30 and chose the Sichuan spice level, the spiciest option, which was incredibly flavorful and made me sweat — just as I expected!

One thing I found interesting was how many non-Asian customers were dining here. Most of them chose very mild spice levels (0 or 1), resulting in a lighter broth.

The atmosphere was lively and warm, unlike the slightly chilly exterior. The salmon was tasty and the vegetables nicely cooked. The staff kept our table clear and were very attentive. It was a great dining experience that I would gladly recommend.

Based on their opening hours, I would suggest Michelle plan to visit on a Wednesday or Thursday afternoon between 2-4pm. This appears to be after the lunch rush and before the dinner crowd starts arriving, so it may be a quieter window for her to drop in. Friday late afternoon between 3-5pm could also work, as it's before the weekend dinner rush typically starts on Friday nights."

Came here on a busy Saturday and this place needs more love. I ordered the chicken plate to share with my sister and we loved all the flavors in plate.
